    <p>Elaine Liu - Hi! I'm from Long Island, NY and I'm currently a sophomore majoring in Computer Science
    at Stony Brook University. Both of my parents are dentists and I was originally going to follow in their
    footsteps and become a dentist as well. It was a shock to everyone when I decided to major in CS instead!
    When I'm not coding, you can usually find me at the gym in my free time or playing goalkeeper on the soccer
    field (I've traveled all over the United States to play soccer). A fun fact about me is that I love bubble tea! </p>
