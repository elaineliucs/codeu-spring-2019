    <h1>Welcome to CodeU Team 27's Project!</h1>
    <p>Messages from the Team: </p>
    <p>Elaine Liu - Hi! I'm from Long Island, NY and I'm currently a sophomore majoring in Computer Science
    at Stony Brook University. Both of my parents are dentists and I was originally going to follow in their
    footsteps and become a dentist as well. It was a shock to everyone when I decided to major in CS instead!
    When I'm not coding, you can usually find me at the gym in my free time or playing goalkeeper on the soccer
    field (I've traveled all over the United States to play soccer). A fun fact about me is that I love bubble tea! </p>
    <p>Allan Kipkorir - I am Allan Korir, a Sophomore at Princeton  University studying Computer Science
       and taking a certificate in Statistics and Machine Learning.
       I am interested in creating systems that scale to efficiently solve problems,
       and specifically using Artificial Intelligence to do so. I hail from Nairobi, Kenya, and given my experience
       living in a developing country whose economy is rapidly growing,
     I am curious about ways in which we could use technology to allow everyone to benefit from such growth.</p>
    <p>Sabin Gaire - Hi! I am Sabin Gaire from Howard University.
      I am a sophomore majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. I come all the way from Nepal.
      I love playing soccer, cricket and basketball. A fun fact about me is that I have not watched Titanic till date.</p>
    <p>Sandy Xie -Hi! Iâ€™m Sandy Xie, a 2nd year at Georgia Institute of Technology studying computer
      science concentrating in artificial intelligence and media.
       I was born in Chicago but spent most of my childhood in Shenzhen,
       China and Atlanta, Georgia. My hobbies include trying foods from different countries,
       bouldering, and sneakers! </p>
    <p>Jonathan Tan (PA) - I'm Jonathan, the Project Advisor for this team.
           I work on the Git project, helping scale it to better meet the needs of large repositories.
           In my free time, I like to play board games and learn languages.</p>
